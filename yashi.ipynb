Consider then the other edge of the cycle connected to $n_j$. It can't connect it to its parent, because that edge is unique and we've already considered it, so it must connect it to one of its children $n_k$. Thus $n_k$ is under $n_j$, and by transitivity it's under $n_i$. Continuing this reasoning to all the other edges of the cycle, we get that all the other nodes we encounter are under the node $n_i$. However since we have a cycle we must reach $n_i$ again, thus obtaining that $n_i$ is under $n_i$. This is impossible because the under relation is irreflexive, so we got a contradiction and a cycle can't exist.\n",
